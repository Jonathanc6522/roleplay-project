# roleplay-project

I intend to add more in in resource; I want to put in the members of club who're most reliable, as well as the club prez. & teacher

The meat of this website is really in the lore section; it's going to contain everything along the lines of how to get started, that way if you want to come in and join everything is a little smoother.

I want to add a carousel into the index page, maybe even a video or two, but there's a few problems with that currently.
- it's the summer
- we're all in quarantine (or at least social distancing)
- once school starts up again, who's to say it will start in person?
- if it DOES start in person, I will need permission from people to record & put pictures of them on the site.


This marks the end of my hopes for this website.


As for actual intentions, I'm intending to have this in it's most basic form as a way to quickly gauge if this is actually something the other members of club want. 

A couple things I'm torn between:
- Would it be better to have a whole other site for helping make characters, or at least to help understand the sheet?
- How should I advertise campaign creation? my experience with it is minimal...

if you have ideas let me know!
