# roleplay-project

 Hello! My name is Jonathan, (Cutler) and I am the residing normal person/masochist of Roleplay Club(RPclub).
...in this case, better known as the site designer & lone programmer...
I'm creating this website out of the goodness of my heart; I could be doing literally anything else. Instead however, I'm doing this, not because I have to, but because I love RPclub, and it's one of the sole reasons I'll be sad to leave HSTAT after next year. I want to keep being a part of this club, and I want to see it thrive even after I'm gone. I want it to live; to be able to take in shy, nervous, and socially awkward teens and help them make heads or tails of highschool.

 As for the website portion of this README, I've created a mostly barebones version of what I hope this site can become. (..and as far as bare bones comes, I'm actually really proud..)

I intend to add more in in resource; I want to put in the members of club who're most reliable, as well as the club prez. & teacher

The meat of this website is really in the lore section; it's going to contain everything along the lines of how to get started, that way if you want to come in and join everything is a little smoother.

I want to add a carousel into the index page, maybe even a video or two, but there's a few problems with that currently.
- it's the summer
- we're all in quarantine (or at least social distancing)
- once school starts up again, who's to say it will start in person?
- if it DOES start in person, I will need permission from people to record & put pictures of them on the site.


This marks the end of my hopes for this website.


As for actual intentions, I'm intending to have this in it's most basic form as a way to quickly gauge if this is actually something the other members of club want. 

A couple things I'm torn between:
- Would it be better to have a whole other site for helping make characters, or at least to help understand the sheet?
- How should I advertise campaign creation? my experience with it is minimal...

if you have ideas let me know!

P.S. 
 incase you didn't notice, the way I make this kinda stuff is an (attempted) fusion of professionalism, comedy, and my stream of (un)consciousness. I hope it isn't too distracting, and has at least made you do that thing where you smile weakly and do a nasal exhale.
